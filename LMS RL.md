## LMS Reinforcement Learning Model


### 1. Define the Environment:
- **States**: The state can include the teams that have already been picked, remaining lives, and other relevant features like recent performance statistics.
- **Actions**: The actions are the choices of teams that have not yet been picked.
- **Rewards**: Define a reward system, e.g., +1 for a correct prediction, -1 for a wrong prediction.
- **Transition Function**: Define how the state changes after an action is taken. This includes updating the teams picked and remaining lives.

### 2. Choose a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:
- **Q-Learning** is a widely used model-free RL algorithm suitable for this problem.
- You'll maintain a Q-table, where Q(s, a) represents the expected reward of taking action a in state s.

### 3. Preprocess Data:
- Gather and preprocess data that will be part of the state, like team statistics and match information.

### 4. Initialise the Q-Table:
- Initialise the Q-table with zeros or small random values.
- The table will have dimensions corresponding to the number of possible states and actions.

### 5. Set Hyperparameters:
- **Learning Rate (α)**: Determines how much of the new Q-value estimate to adopt.
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: Indicates the importance of future rewards.
- **Exploration Rate (ε)**: Governs the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

### 6. Implement the Learning Algorithm:
Iteratively perform the following steps:
- **Observe Current State**: Based on previous actions and current information.
- **Choose an Action**: Use an ε-greedy policy to either explore a random action or exploit the best-known action based on the Q-table.
- **Execute the Action**: Select the team and observe the outcome of the match.
- **Receive Reward**: Get the reward based on the outcome.
- **Update the Q-Table**: Use the Q-learning update rule:
  $$
  Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α [r + γ \max_{a'}Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
  $$
  
  where \( s' \) is the new state, \( r \) is the reward, and the \(\max_{a'}\) term represents the highest Q-value for the next state.
- **Update the State**: Move to the new state, reflecting the teams picked and lives remaining.
- **Repeat** until the game ends, either through reaching the end of the season or losing all lives.

### 7. Training:
- Train the agent over multiple simulated seasons to allow it to learn from various scenarios.
- Monitor convergence by tracking changes in the Q-values or the agent's performance.

### 8. Evaluation:
- Test the trained agent in simulated games or unseen seasons to evaluate its performance.
- Analyze how the agent behaves and the strategies it learns.

### 9. Tools and Libraries:
- You can build this from scratch using NumPy for matrix operations, or use a library like OpenAI Gym to define the environment.
